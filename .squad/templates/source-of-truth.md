## File Authority Table

| File | Status | Who May Write | Who May Read |
|------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` | **Authoritative governance.** All roles, handoffs, gates, and enforcement rules. | Repo maintainer (human) | Squad (Coordinator) |
| `.squad/decisions.md` | **Authoritative decision ledger.** Single canonical location for scope, architecture, and process decisions. | Squad (Coordinator) — append only | All agents |

| `.squad/agents/{name}/history.md` | **Derived / append-only.** Personal learnings. Never authoritative for enforcement. | Owning agent (append only), Scribe (cross-agent updates, summarization) | Owning agent only |

## Rules

1. If `squad.agent.md` and any other file conflict, `squad.agent.md` wins.
2. Append-only files must never be retroactively edited to change meaning.
3. Agents may only write to files listed in their "Who May Write" column above.
4. Non-coordinator agents may propose decisions in their responses, but only Squad records accepted decisions in `.squad/decisions.md`.
